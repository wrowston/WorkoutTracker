# WorkoutTracker
Application that keeps a history of user submitted workouts developed in Java

An application for people to keep a history of completed workouts to monitor progress and find an old 
workout they enjoyed.

This application asks the user questions, takes in user input, and stores the input.

A new workout is created when the user enters "start" when prompted. Each workout is unique by date and 
the exercises it is composed of. The user can search for previously completed workouts by date or can prompt 
the application to show every workout entered by the user. 

The application stores information such as exercise type, how many sets are completed, 
how many repititions are completed per set, and the weight of each exercise. 

The user can keep adding exercises to a workout by entering "yes" and can stop adding exercises by 
entering "no" when prompted. The command "quit" stops the program.
