Ways to persist (have data exist outside of application) data:
- *** Database (MongoDB) - Running this on a server (local server)
    - basically, running this on localhost:<some port>

- ** save data to a .csv file (comma-separated file)
    - write to this file when you add a workout
    - read from the file when this workout application starts up


Ways of running this application:
    - Compile each class, and run Main.java inside a terminal instead of Intellij
    - Create a JAR file and then run this
    - Use Java Swing
